# FAQs

### I am unable to install the slack app

Try re-installing. Make sure you are logged in to the right slack workspace.


### Slack app installation needs admin permission
Your slack workspace admin has made it mandatory to take their approval before installing any app to the workspace. Request them to approve your request by sending a note during the installation process.

You can assure them that this app is safe and does not collect or store any data. See [privacy policy](#privacy-policy).

### I am unable to generate Slack API key
Try re-installing the slack app and make sure you click allow during the installation.

### Slack status is not updating
1. Check if you have actually pasted the Slack API key. Generate and paste again, if in doubt.
2. Try a different emoji.
3. Check status emoji format, if you are using a custom slack emoji. `:smile:` will work whereas `:smile` or `smile:` will not work. To prevent confusion, copy paste the emoji directly from a slack chat.
4. The custom emoji used is not available in your slack workspace. Use only those emojis that are available in your slack workspace.

### Extension does not work sometimes
Refreshing the meeting page should bring the extension back.

### I want to uninstall this extension and slack app
1. Unistall slack app first, by using the **Revoke Slack API key** available within the extension.
2. Right click on the extension icon and remove the extension.


# Privacy policy
This extension or the slack app do not store any keys or data in any form. All data is stored locally inside chrome browser. Slack status API calls are made directly to Slack servers and no intermediate servers are used.
